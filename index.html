	<h2>What's In The Box?</h2>

	<h3>Here is a list of the features of the friendliest grid on earth.</h3>
	<ol class="list">
		<li><span>1</span>Responsive </li><p>The CSS is responsive and all layout, typography, and images will scale appropriately. All the elements are styled in ems to keep all the padding, borders, margins, typography, and images consistent. This grid system is not dependent on a particular device or the zoom level. The friendliest grid system wishes to be friends with every device or screen resolution. No matter whether your user is viewing your website with a phone, tablet, PC, or HDTV, you can rest easy knowing that your content will be displayed accurately and still retain your design elements.</p>
		<li><span>2</span>Backwards Compatibility</li><p>Many people are not obsessed with owning the newest iPhone or Android phones and still use their older device with an older operating system. Some older phones even lack proper ram and lack the ability to process Javascript. If you using The Friendliest Grid, you need not fret. It is lightweight and will display your content with even the most limited of resources.</p> 
		<li><span>3</span>A Responsive, Touch-Capable Image Slider</li><p>Bxslider is an excellent asset to the friendliest grid on earth. It's ability to operate on any touch capable device is unrivaled in other in its class. More information about how to configure Bxslider can be found at the <a href="http://www.bxslider.com">bx slider homepage.</a> </p>
		<li><span>4</span>Retina &amp Non-retina Display Support </li><p>Ever since the first retina capable iPod, iPad, iPhone, and Apple's retina display on their MacBook Pros, coders and web designers have been searching for a way to serve up images and icons that look crisp and clear. Unfortunately, the only way to do this was to serve up many copies of the same image, which puts a huge overhead on the total weight of the site and slows the load time. Now, through the use of SVG images it is now possible to view the same image at the different resolutions, while maintaining clean, sharp edges consistently.</p>
		<li><span>5</span>Works on any HD TV</li><p>Yep, that's right it will grow to fill even an HDTV set. With some well planned custom media queries any website designed with the friendliest grid system will be easy to read even on an HDTV from your living room couch.</p>
		<li><span>6</span>Easy to remember class names.</li><p>For coders who are planning to implement their site, this is the best news of all. The decision to make this the friendliest grid was also a decision to make it the easiest grid system to use and make your own. For example, one single column row, has been given the class "row", then nested inside the "row"" is "col." Two columns is "two col", then "three col", and "four col". It's that easy.</p>
		<li><span>7</span>Uses Font Symbol Library</li><p>For anyone who wants to develop their website with the current technology, I have included a few fonts from Icomoon. If you take a quick look at the bottom of this page you will see some social media icons. These are not normal pixel or even vector graphics. They are part of a custom font library. This will ensure your symbols stay lean, clean, and crisp. You can go to <a href="http://www.icomoon.io">Icomoon</a> and create your own customizable font set to use for any symbols you may need. The font libraries also come with legacy support for browsers that don't understand the @fontface syntax. My suggestion is to only download what you know you will need. This saves bandwidth overhead which decreases load time.</p>
